## Heads or Tails

A simple and fun coin-flip game built with React. Test your luck by guessing Heads or Tails and see if you can build a winning streak!

## HOW TO PLAY

The game displays a coin and asks: "Your move: heads or tails?"

You can also play directly from [GitHub](https://rdavison23.github.io/M4-js-html-Games/).
Choose either:

- Heads → click the Heads button
- Tails → click the Tails button

The coin will flip randomly:

- ✅ If your guess matches the result, you’ll see a winning message (e.g., "You win!!" or "Boom! You crushed it!").
- ❌ If your guess is wrong, you’ll see a losing message (e.g., "Flip again!" or "Not this time...").

Stats are tracked automatically:

- Total flips: how many times you’ve played
- Total wins: how many correct guesses you’ve made
- Win streak: how many consecutive wins you’ve achieved
